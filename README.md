This was an annual ball gift from Aalto-university's guild of electrical engineering to Tampere University's guild of electrical engineering. The code is simple Arduino C++ that basically just controls a 2x16 lcd display, a buzzer and a switch. When the switch is pressed down, a timer starts and stops when the switch is released.
